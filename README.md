- ⚡ Fun fact: My nick Dragongirl ドラゴン was given by a Japanese friend, <who always on the fly, processes and burns the code like a red dragon> coming from IRC days. I am one of the first testers of the internet or better to say www, which was, in between universities. I was a volunteer student sending and receiving messages and I am proudly one of the people who first witnessed text messaging via dial-up. I am a strong believer that knowledge is power and people should access knowledge to support human progress... I am recently developing high level AI architecture, for better user experiences..
